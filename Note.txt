Git
    Synchronize your local repository with the remote repository on GitHub.com

    $ git fetch
    Downloads all history from the remote tracking branches

    $ git merge
    Combines remote tracking branches into current local branch

    $ git push
    Uploads all local branch commits to GitHub

    $ git pull
    Updates your current local working branch with all new commits from the corresponding remote branch on GitHub. git pull is a combination of git fetch and git merge


Course start --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

post questions to MatterMost

Ashe - instructor in Galvanize
Dave - instructor

Name, location, team/role, background (languages/experience)
Chris Harden - Unity developer

P1 - Need to develop and deploy software quickly while maintaining high security level
    - mostly legacy waterfall practices
    - agile, steimied by cybersecurity 
    - solution - design secure software/process/testing, etc... accredidation done by time code is complete

CATO - continous authority to operate
    1. People 2. Process 3. Pipelines
    AGILE!!!! XP 
p1- common Platform
workshop  - hands on experience developing and deploying on P1

Agile XP = extreme programming

Platform 1 is new



Pipelines ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
pipeline - tool used to automate software delivery process
CI - continuous integration
    merge work together every day with other devs
CD - continous delivery

pipeline builds the code, runs tests (CI), and safely deploys a new version of the application (CD)

Pipeline value 
 - deploy software faster, less manual errors, ...
 cost -
    = write automated tests
    = need a continous integration server
    = devs need to push/merge changes OFTEN
 benefits
    - less bugs, less risk
    - less context switching
    - reduced testing costs
    - less pressure
    - customers see improvements
 wins
    - speed
    - safety
        - continous security (on libraries you are importing as well)

robust unit testing suite!!!

Making changes
    - source code management
        - making changes to the same things
        - 
    - Git - manage multiple users on the same code (changes)
    - Conway's Law = communiction structure of an org is often reflected in the file system/branching system

overwriting
branch development
trunk development
    Development branch and Production branch
    Everyone creates a feature branch (lasts 1-3 days)
        make changes
        merge into dev branch
        delete the branch
Merge request 
    - approval (by manager/senior dev)
