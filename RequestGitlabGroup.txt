Next Steps on Platform One
Standard
Requesting a Gitlab Group
Requesting a Gitlab Group
This step MUST be completed before the end of DAY ONE. This will help ensure your request is processed in a timely fashion.

Team Lead Only
This step is ONLY meant to be completed by your team lead. If you are not the team lead, please do NOT request a new gitlab group. If your team already has a repo and a pipeline, you may skip this step.

You can request a new gitlab group here:

https://jira.il2.dso.mil/servicedesk/customer/portal/1/create/191 
This process will create your team's GitLab Group. Within this group, you can create as many projects/repos as you want. Generally speaking, you will need to create one project within your group per service.

When filling out this request, please include the following information:

The specific IL or Impact Level that you will require for both dev and prod
Your full technology stack.
If you omit this information we will be unable to take action.

Our goal is to have a gitlab group provisioned to you by the end of day 3 of this workshop. Once you have your gitlab group, we will make sure you are able to add members and create repos for your apps.
